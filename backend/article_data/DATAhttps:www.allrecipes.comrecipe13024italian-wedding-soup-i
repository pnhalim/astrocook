First I used about 7 cups of broth. 6 cups of chicken broth, 1 can of beef broth. The beef broth DEFINITELY adds that extra punch this soup needs. Definitely only use 1/2 cup of orzo, and boil in a seperate pot. I threw some green onions in. With the 7 cups of broth, it was enough for 4 people, + 1 days leftovers, which you'll definitely want! Next time I'll bake the meatballs before hand to get some of the grease off."}, {"@type": "Review", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "patti v"}, "reviewBody": "this is a good basic wedding soup. for myself, it follows the family recipe that i use. as for the meatballs, i use a combo of lean ground beef (93% lean) and ground pork. it's seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder; one egg and either breadcrumbs or wet bread slice that i crumble in. don't cook the meatballs in the broth (i use chicken and in a pinch will use veggie broth). i bake the meatballs at 350 for 20 minutes. this will allow some of the fat to come out but it really doesn't matter because the bread crumbs or drier bread will soak up some of the fat so there is very little to come out. also cook the acni de pepe in the broth. nothing else is added except parmesan when serving with garlic bread."}, {"@type": "Review", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sher Marshall"}, "reviewBody": "Made this for the first time.
