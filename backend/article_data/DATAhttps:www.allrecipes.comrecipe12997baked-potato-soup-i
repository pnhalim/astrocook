It can't be a 5 star recipe if you had to make changes. And if they're giving 5 stars to their own variation, they shouldn't be doing that here since it's a different recipe. That seems to be what many of the 5 star reviews for this recipe do. I was making it according to the recipe, but it wasn't nearly thick or creamy enough for what I wanted, so like many others did, I added instant potatoes. I also added more water and chicken bouillon since this is a small batch. If I make this again, I'll leave out the flour entirely and just use the instant potatoes to make it \"thick, creamy.\" I'd also change the title to potato and cheese soup."}], "mainEntityOfPage": {"@type": ["WebPage"], "@id": "https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/12997/baked-potato-soup-i/", "breadcrumb": {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "item": {"@id": "https://www.allrecipes.com/recipes/184/soups-stews-and-chili/soup/vegetable-soup/", "name": "Vegetable Soup Recipes"}}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "item": {"@id": "https://www.allrecipes.com/recipes/1552/soups-stews-and-chili/soup/vegetable-soup/potato-soup/", "name": "Potato Soup Recipes"}}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 3, "item": {"@id": "https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/12997/baked-potato-soup-i/", "name": "Baked Potato Soup"}}]}}, "about": []}]
